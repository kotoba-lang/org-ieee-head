;; test/head_test.cljs — build the command and compare it with the system
;; head, byte for byte AND by exit status.
;;
;; SUCCESS paths only, deliberately. /usr/bin/head refuses `-n 0` and a
;; missing operand on STDERR and exits 1; there is no stderr capability --
;; :io/write is fd 1 and only fd 1 -- so those bytes cannot be produced and
;; are not claimed. The cases below are the ones this implementation says it
;; matches.
;;
;; This does not assert that the guest COMPILES. It compiles it, packages it
;; into a standalone binary, runs that binary, and compares its bytes and its
;; exit status against /bin/cat -- because `:ok true` from a compiler means
;; the artifact was built, not that it is right, and this repository's whole
;; claim is about what the artifact does.
;;
;; Every case is passed as an ARGUMENT VECTOR, never through a shell. zsh does
;; not word-split an unquoted variable, so `cmd $args` hands the whole string
;; over as ONE argument -- which silently turns a multi-argument test into a
;; single-argument one and makes the join logic and `-n` look tested when they
;; are not. Measured 2026-09-09: exactly that mistake made `-n hi` and
;; `a b c d e` pass before either was implemented or exercised.
;;
;;   AMU_HOME=<amu checkout> nbb test/echo_test.cljs
;;
;; Exits 0 when every case matches, 1 on any difference, and 2 when it could
;; not run at all -- a distinct code, so "did not run" is never read as "ran
;; and found nothing".
